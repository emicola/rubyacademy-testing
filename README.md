## testing

### Slides

See slides for brief introduction to code testing and main ruby testing frameworks

### Example:

* Countdown: how many days to Christmas?
  Goal: in order to make tests reliable we need to use stubs to set dates to fixed values.
  Student Activity: what happens when today is december 27th?
  Bonus: dependency injection makes tests simpler

### Student Activities:
  * complete specs/array_spec.rb and make all tests pass
